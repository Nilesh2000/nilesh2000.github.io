I've always wanted to create a digital space for myself on the internet, but I kept procrastinating and never got started. This year, I'm determined to change that. One of my New Year's resolutions for 2025 is to write more.

I read extensively and maintain a comprehensive collection of bookmarks (yes, I have a hoarding problem üòÖ). I also take plenty of notes on Notion while reading and learning. The idea behind this blog is to share these notes and make them accessible from anywhere.

My founder Chinmay says: **"Writing crystallizes your thinking."**. At my current company, One2N, the founders encourage us to keep learning something new every day and share the knowledge with others. And this blog will be my way of putting that advice into practice.

## Tech Stack

### Framework - Hugo
Its fast, static, simple to setup and allows me to ship quickly. Since starting at One2N, I've been working with Go and have developed a liking for the ecosystem.

For styling, I‚Äôm starting with vanilla CSS to brush up on my rusty skills. I might eventually pivot to Tailwind to see what the hype about utility-first CSS is all about.

### Analytics - Umami
I decided against Google Analytics due to privacy concerns. After that, I spent far too much time exploring [awesome-analytics](https://github.com/oxnr/awesome-analytics) for alternatives.
I eventually setted on **Umami**, which I've self-hosted. It's open source and comes with a sleek dashboard. I went ahead with **Supabase** for the DB and **Vercel** for deployment.

### Deployment - GitHub Pages
Gets me up and running quickly. I might set up a custom domain and integrate it with Cloudflare in the future.

*Fin! Until next time* üëãüèª
