Hi! I am a backend engineer at [One2N](https://one2n.io/) in Pune, where I primarily work in Golang. I specialize in building efficient and scalable systems, and I love sharing what I've learnt along the way.

A few facts about me:
- I enjoy reading tech blogs, murder mysteries, and non-fiction.
- I’m an avid runner, with a 5k PB of 25 minutes.
- I’m a die-hard Formula 1 fan and haven’t missed a race since 2018.
- I spend my free time doing origami.
- I like using bullet points everywhere.
