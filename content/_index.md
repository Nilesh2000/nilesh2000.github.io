Hi! I am a backend engineer at [One2N](https://one2n.io/) in Pune, where I primarily work in Golang. I enjoy building efficient and scalable systems, and I love sharing what I learnt along the way.

**Some things about me:-**
- I enjoy reading books on personal finance and technology.
- I am an avid runner with a 5k PB of 25 minutes.
- I am a massive F1 fan, and I haven't missed a race since 2018.
- I like using bullet points everywhere.
